# Data Structures & Algorithms Specialization (UC San Diego)

This repository contains my work for the **Coursera Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization** 
offered by the University of California San Diego.

## Repository Structure

- **01-algorithmic-toolbox/**
  - `notes/` : Markdown notes, complexity analysis, and theory
  - `assignments/` : Solutions for the course assignments, organized by module
